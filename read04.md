# PROCESS & DESIGN
## in this section of the book talk about the process that you can use when you are creating a new website AND WHO ARE YOUR audience, AND WHAT THEY ARE LOKING FOR, ALSO HOW YOU CAN present information visitors want to see IT MEAN HOW YOUR WEBSITE IT LOOK LIKE 
## The Command Line!
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

The command line typically presents you with a prompt. As you type, it will be displayed after the prompt. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.
### Basic Navigation!
The first command we are going to learn is pwd which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is. #

#### About Files!
Ok, the first thing we need to appreciate with linux is that under the hood, everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc. To begin with, this won't affect what we do too much but keep it in mind as it helps with understanding the behaviour of Linux as we manage files and directories.
